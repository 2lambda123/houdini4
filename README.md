# üê≥ HOUDINI: Hundreds of Offensive and Useful Docker Images for Network Intrusion
HOUDINI is a curated list of **Network Security** related Docker Images for Network Intrusion purposes. A lot of images are created and kept updated through our [RAUDI](https://github.com/cybersecsi/RAUDI) repository. Pretty dope, eh?

Other than listing **a lot** of tools we provide ``docker run`` commands for every one of them and useful **Cheatsheets** for some of them (You can also contribute by suggesting new commands to add).

### Built with  
HOUDINI is created using:
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

And using the following packages:
* [fuse.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fuse.js)
* [react-github-btn](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-github-btn)
* [react-github-corner](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-github-corner)

* [inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer)


## Add a tool
A tool is composed by:
- A markdown file in the */tools* folder
- An entry into a Javascript file (in */web/src/config/tools.ts*)

We want people to contribute, so we created a script to automate the process of adding a new tool. All you have to do is add the **description** and (optionally) the **cheatsheet**. The command is ``bootstrap``, here is an example:
<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/bootstrap.gif">
</p>

To use the ``boostrap`` command you have to:
- ``pnpm install`` in the `web` folder
- ``pnpm run bootstrap`` in the `web` folder
- Add the mandatory informations to add a new tool

The mandatory informations are the following:
- **Fancy name**: The long version name of the tool
- **Docker Image**: The Docker Image (in the format *repo/image*)
- **Official Doc**: A link to the official documentation for the tool
- **Run Command**: The run command

The last thing you have to do is to add the **description** and (optionally) the **cheatsheet**.

## Development
This section provides a set of commands to run the application locally. 

PLEASE use **pnpm** over **npm**

### Setup
This is a **React** based application. Before running it you have to install all the needed packages with the following command:
```
cd ./web && pnpm install
```

### Build
To build the app you have to run:
```
pnpm run build
```

### Run
To execute the app locally you have to run:
```
pnpm dev
```

Please note that the folder used for showing the Markdown files in the React application is **not** the */tools* folder, but a directory inside the source code of the React app itself (*/web/src/_tools*). Every time you run ``yarn start`` from the main directory the */tools* folder is copied in */web/src/_tools*. So if you add a new tool while the app is running it won't show up until you update the */web/src/_tools* folder. For this reason a command has been added to ease this work, you can easily copy the */tools* folder by running the following command while in the main directory:
```
pnpm run update
```


## Roadmap
Here is the current roadmap:
- [x] Responsive Design
- [x] Add copy botton in ``<code>`` tags (make it a component)
- [x] Check ``bootstrap`` command on Linux systems
- [x] Fix margin, padding in tool pages to make it more readable
- [x] Add tools (reach at least 100)
- [x] Add labels **[MUST]**
- [ ] Define customizable fields **[COULD]**
- [ ] Add toolbox for customizing commands **[COULD]**
- [ ] Add webapp snippet (to keep interesting commands) **[COULD]**
- [ ] Add ``bashify`` script **[COULD]**
